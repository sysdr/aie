# Coding Standards and Best Practices

## File Organization
- Use kebab-case for file names: `user-service.js`
- Group related files in feature folders
- Keep configuration separate from business logic

## Code Style
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Comment complex business logic
- Follow consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Use async/await instead of callbacks

## Git Commit Messages
- Use present tense: "Add user authentication"
- Be specific about what changed
- Reference issue numbers when applicable

## Testing Standards
- Write tests before implementation (TDD)
- Aim for 80%+ coverage
- Test both happy path and edge cases
- Use descriptive test names

## Documentation
- Update README for major changes
- Document API endpoints
- Include setup instructions
- Maintain changelog
